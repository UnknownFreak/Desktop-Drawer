Simple desktop drawer application

Requirements: Gu.Wpf.Geometry

Exit application with Esc
Right click opens up color picker
Left button draws
Ctrl + z to undo what has been drawn

Future improvements:
Pen types (eg highlight marker, eraser etc.)
Scalability of the ColorPicker (cannot be resized at the moment)
TopBar (pen/ exit/ etc)
Color pallete in ColorPicker
Multi monitor support

Issues:
Color selection can sometimes be wonky
